## Housekeeping
- Mac is actually easier for coding because MacOS is Unix based
- Three-minute thesis competition
## General Notes
- when getting new mac, don't import applications import files
- omni searches can be exported to CSVs for lit reviews
- notes should be pushed to Markdown each week to show learning and practice, put onto DH website
- share GitHub account w team

### Improve Questions
##### Open Ended Questions
1. How do we get the humanities to accept digital methods?
3. Where does it end? Where does it start?
4. How can different disciplines leverage computational skills?
5. What is similar, what is different?
7. How do we maintain interdisciplinary accessibility?
8. How do we communicate across disciplines? Between humanities and computer science?
##### Closed Ended Questions
None!
##### Both
2. What is digital humanities methodology?
6. How do we define basic?
##### Change a close-ended question to an open one and vice versa:
2. Closing: What are basic computational skills?
6. Opening: How do we define digital humanities methodology and its scope?
##### What are the advantages/disadvantages of both types?
- Open carry more nuance, whereas closed give more specific answers
- Open delivers context
### Prioritize Questions
##### Two Most Important Questions
1.  **How do we communicate across disciplines? Between humanities and computer science?**
2. **What are basic computational skills?** 
##### Why?
- Number 2 is helpful to clarify what skills to prioritize
- Number 1 is broader but helps establish norms and communication and further learning
##### Other Group's Questions
- **How do computational methods assist in literature review?
- **What is the role of AI in the humanities?
- **What humanities methodologies/methods can work with computational skills?
- **What additional problems will these skills present?**
