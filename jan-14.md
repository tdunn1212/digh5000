# Lessons on Public Humanities from Civic Sphere

***“Traditionally, public humanities has meant either widening the readership of humanities scholarship or working in cultural heritage institutions like museums, archives, galleries, and libraries”***

- An approach that values humanities participation from the public
- Requires interdisciplinary roles
- Allows for opportunities to rethink experiences with civic engagement and digital work
- We should be inspired by inclusion, community inquiry, and public benefit design, humanists can partner with many groups while rethinking  the public
- (lessons as headings)

#### Early and In-Process Inclusion

- “Allowing for the public to participate in the design and development of a project from its very beginning demonstrates the principle of building with and not for”
- Community involvement requires a slower pace that allows for feedback and suggestions "the speed of inclusion"
- Social media creates a good opportunity for wide public engagement
- Public feedback allows for us to recognize areas of shortcomings in designs that developers might be blind to
- “The assumption that scholarship is inherently a form of “public good” is not a productive place to start a conversation with those outside of the academy”
- Humanities work should be **process**, not product, with public engagement at all stages of work

#### Problem Scoping and Community Inquiries

- “problem solving begins and ends with community building. Problem solving, in the civic and public sector, takes place on teams with various stakeholders, including citizens, residents, community organizers, and policy and advocacy specialists”
- Outlining events based on concerns like hackathons, and datathons
- Datathons are effective ways of reaching marginalized and underrepresented communities
- Humanities scholars engage with culture, but often do not actually immerse themselves in the culture and the people involved
- Less concrete solutions also make humanities research feel less relevant
- “Instead of analyzing social and cultural patterns from a distance or in solitude, however, we humanities scholars could stand to set aside our roles as subject specialists and learn to scope problems and explore possible solutions contributed by community workers, working with those who have frontline experiences with solution proposition and implementation.”
- Collaboration and interpretation of shared problems is among the first step to actualizing humanities work

#### Design and Making as Civic Actions

- “the task of the humanities is to teach literature and philosophy in such a way that people will be able to imagine what a socially just world should be”
- Humanistic thinking should be connected to making and design
- By transforming critical thought into action, design allows us to imagine a different reality
- Public design should lower the barrier of entry and maintain public integrity while not making assumptions about the public you serve
- Digital humanists are good at expressing cultural critiques by making things like databases, websites, or hypertext
- “I urge digital humanists, especially those with digital making or design skills, to apply their experience to projects with a public purpose.”

***“Designing with (and not for) the public could mean the participation in the following domains of action:***

1. Organizing public projects with a civic cause through the design of a web interface, a database, or hashtag campaign, and setting a common agenda at community tech events such as hackathons and datathons;
2. prototyping a community-driven digital object such as an oral history archive, a multimedia document, a digital library, or public information products such as web maps or data visualizations
3. intervening in a civic or public process in a way that furthers a humanist agenda”

#### Coworking Across Lines of Power

- “Communities can emerge across lines of power, but communications that lead to opinion formation can further divide strong and weak publics.”
- A stronger public can help to ensure less division, this is the work of public humanists
- Those in academia are more powerful, and should engage across lines of power to avoid harm in their research

# Seminar

**Public humanities:** dedicated to basic propositions that there can be a complimentary and enriching relationship between life and humanities research, teaching, and programming

- Dedicated to collective societal good and engaging with the public while doing research
- "tenaciously in dialogue" with the public and the academy
- The term was coined in the US in the mid 20th century, but practices existed long before
- Stemmed from decline in support for the humanities to make humanities less elitest and engage with showing measurable benefits in communities
- Also has natural and grassroots origins in activist spaces

###### Main Goals of Public Humanities

- Accessibility- open access, accessible language
- Collaboration- interdisciplinary, institutions and individuals engaging
- Education- humanities disciplines
- Social Justice- emphasis on marginalized communities
- Public Service- benefitting the community
- Community- collective creation of reality

***Examples of public humanities: public arts with social purpose, educational and public access podcasts***

**Benefits**

- Meeting needs
- Collaboration
- Input from many groups
- Highlights humanities' importance
- Social justice
- Community based perspectives

**Challenges**

- Non experts
- Contention between groups
- Hierarchies and representation
- Goals may be unclear or not met
- Funding
- Coordination
- Ethical considerations

**Future Developments:**

- Citizen directed humanities
- Moving away from top down knowledge engagement
- Changing how students are evaluated, research production
- Development of more digital archives and interactive sites/apps

###### Community

- We have communities of interest, geographic communities, communities of affiliation, and communities of identity
	- Communities of interest have shared interests and hobbies
	- Communities of affiliation are organized around work, organizations, religion, family
	- Geographic communities are organized based on locality, heritage, shared investments in local community
	- Communities of identity are based on heritage, sexuality, gender, religion
- We can intersect and belong to many different communities, intersectionality
- Communities can be self-identified, or identified by society
- Community is very important, but being in communities can lead us to making assumptions about others and lead to conflict
	- It's important to consider how you represent your community and how you think about other communities

###### Engagement

- Doing public work is different from making academic work public. Available is not always accessible
- Community engaged work starts in collaboration
	- Communities know themselves best

***Principled Community Engagement is "doing any type of public DH work requires an intentional decision from the beginning of the project that identifies and invites in community"***

##### Community Engaged Principles

- Relationships, good partnerships need community to feel valued
- Reciprocity, put resources back into the community and build capacity
- Community agency, from design to dissemination we put community needs first
- Equity, recognizing systemic biases from universities. Committing to inclusivity at all stages of projects
- Openness, to diverse expertise and other ways of knowing, to making mistakes, to communication
- Collaboration, commitments to co-design, valuing community expertise, involving collaborators at every step

DH Projects, Sources, Processed, Presented, Miriam Posner (2014)

- Sources are files, images, texts, numbers, video, sound, documents, artifacts
- Processed are how sources are organized, edited, processed, digitized, quantified
- Presented is how they are visualized and made accessible

How can you leverage your digital knowledge to engage with community? What do you have to offer?

- Allowing space for conversations and open spaces for dialogue
- How to keep things safe online, how to manage hate and difficult conversations
