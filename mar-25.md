# Accessibility and Design in Interactive Experiences 

## Housekeeping
- Keep *all* receipts for DHSI
## Sean's Presentation
- focusing more on the reception of work rather than what makes your creative process easier
### Universal Design Theory
##### ***We should always keep the largest audience in mind when creating designs. There is no one homogenous user, we are working with a variety of different people***
- Disability includes a different amount of abilities that other "abled" audiences don't have
- Accessibility can help everyone, for example, the curb cut at pedestrian intersections
- Even screen readers can help sighted audiences process information differently and simultaneously
- **Universal design is helpful for everyone, not just a marginal disabled community. It is in everyone's best interest to implement universal design methods**
- are ways of learning accounted for at Carleton?
- are specific ways of learning privileged?
	- specific deadlines and lack of compassion on deadlines
- can the privileging of specific ways of learning be an accessibility issue?
- ***Different models of disability and how this coheres with universal design, universal design acknowledges the social model, where our design excludes many groups of people, expanding our ways of design expands who can access learning, who is disabled, etc.***
### Examples from the Experiential Learning Hub
- Students can access screensharing through VR headsets, there can be multiple means of engagement and physical space management
- ELH collaborates with PMC and include 'what to expect' guides that aid student participation, and student feedback forms

### Discussion on Game Narratives and Accessibility
#### Jagoda on Kinds of Difficulty
- Mechanical (challenge with completing the game)
- Interpretive (challenge with understanding narrative)
- Affective (challenge with emotional participation)
> "The mechanical is in primary conversation with game studies, the interpretive with literary criticism, and the affective with interdisciplinary constellation of affect theory"
- People can "fail" to interact with a game on the level that they cannot with passive media interaction
- It is a challenging situation to mediate, since for some games "difficulty" is crucial for fully experiencing affective and interpretive parts of the narrative (e.g. Celeste, Elden Ring, you need to be challenged enough to feel a sense of accomplishment)
	- Celeste has an assist mode that allows for some to get help and still experience the game's narrative in cases where they have mechanical challenges

> Accessibility exists when users can easily make use of digital resources with their choice of technology and can cognitively process information from that resource through that technology

#### Questions
- do we agree with game difficulty as an accessibility issue?
- can we think of resources that might alleviate accessibility concerns in gaming, especially where mechanical challenges are pivotal to gameplay?
- Should course syllabi include notes on mechanical difficulty when assigning games?
- **How can universal design challenge your current projects?**
	- AI girlfriends..? 
	- debates in how AI gf is universal design
	- users who struggle with distinguishing real/fake in AI
- accessible design shows us how narrowly we define who is human, who is our user, who gets to experience narrative
## Prof. Saurette, History and Gaming
- Games have become a dominant medium, many people have experience playing games and see them as a frequent hobby
- the medium and forms of games we play shape cultural narratives and discourse
- **It's hard to think and define what is a game, it prompts a broad understanding in our culture, but we struggle to hone in on a specific concept**
	- implementing concepts of play make it even more challenging to understand
	- "Catch" can be a game, there are rules and participation
	- University is a game in some ways, you learn the rules, participate, and "win"
- Wittgenstein said it was pointless to even define games
- Why do you play games?
	- fulfillment
	- social connection
	- learning
	- catharsis
- Games are not limited to fun and play, there is something deeper to them; in particular digital solo games cut out an element of competition
- Games have many different avenues for how we think about them, we can reflect on them formally, affectively (emotionally), narratively, etc.
	- for decades, game studies were primarily formal
- Our interactions with games bring meaning to them, their experience is so transformative it changes how we think about things and our experiences of them change the nature of the game itself
- Games are an enculturated form of learning
	- Games can teach us about the past, historical games
	- Most history games have the "doing" as killing, which says a lot about what we think of history as and what we think is interesting about history
	- the narrative of history games is often "life sucks", it's modernity patting itself on the back
###### What do games teach us? How do we feel about games?
- People take the history at face value, don't consider which "side" is telling the story and which narratives are favourable to that side
- "authenticity" and accuracy are often only considered in formal areas, not story
- There is a lot of attention and online discourse on "lore" and game meaning
	- what would it mean for us to give this level of attention and scrutiny to history

Game Rating/Reception
- we rate games on the view of the crowd
- more niche enjoyment can only be measured through experience
- forums are very useful spaces for online communication about games in a collaborative and participatory manner
- reaction to games is not natural, it is shaped by culture and radicalized by culture at times
- playable characters require you to simulate yourself in a certain character, this is why playable characters being racialized or female is so contentious for people who are biogted
	- This relates to such a fundamental issue with empathy and lack of empathy in culture and who you see and don't see as human
		- Elon Musk: â€œa fundamental weakness in Western civilization is empathy. The empathy exploit. Your empathy is good, but you need to think it through. And not just be programmed like a robot. I believe in empathy. I think you should care about other people, but you need to have empathy for civilization as a whole and not commit civilizational suicide"

[Interactive fiction through history](https://epoiesen.carleton.ca)

In games, we use our competitive, rule-bound, and culturally mediated behaviour to learn about the world and simualte certain experiences
- it gives us the cognitive ability to imagine the world with certain constraints
- it is very useful to expand our empathy
- this is also why radical groups are so challenged in playing as women lol

[Games: Agency as Art](https://ocul-crl.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01OCUL_CRL/hgdufh/alma991022774628305153)
- the Carleton library has boardgames and a digital game collection (working to restore access to)

TODO: email shawn a/b experiment, update DH notes
