## Data Feminism

Data feminism is an approach that draws on feminist scholarship and action to humanize data and contend with the relationships between data and power

- It values contextualizing, empathy, and intersectionality

- Not letting "numbers speak for themselves"
- Empathizing with the experiences that can be had as represented by datasets and using that to structure our use of them
- Be mindful of intersectional concerns within data use

Includes:

1. Examining power
2. Challenging power
3. Elevating emotion and embodiment
4. Data feminism by considering context
5. Data feminism as rethinking binaries and hierarchies

1. Embracing pluralism
2. Making labour visible and replicable, recognizable

### Baking and Data Feminism

- Notable works: "White and gendered aesthetics and attitudes of #pandemicbaking" by Francesca Scobande

- Paints a privileged representation of experiences during the pandemic
- Dominated by white, upper class, women who used the pandemic as means to indulging in hobbies
- Depicts women as caregivers and domestic labourers, it's not necessarily patriarchal since it's by choice
- These trends reenforce systemic inequalities and prop up white gender norms
- Trends diminish lower class women as "bad-homemakers" for not having luxury items

- "Eating, looking, and living clean: techniques of white femininity in contemporary neoliberal food culture" by Karen Wilkes

- Aesthetics of relatable and curated upper class white femininity fronts food trends as extreme approaches to healthy earing. This lens intersects with gender, race, and class to promote neo-liberal mantras of the hard working female entrepreneur and value of "choice" which denies structural advantages held by white upper-class women

### Online Forums

- Online baking forums are often constructive, there is passive-aggressive shade, but there is mostly a sense of community despite the fleeting nature of interactions
- Community as structured around common interest

TikTok posts that frame baking from scratch as cost and time efficient

- Misleading to promote that money is saved, all the ingredients are already on hand
- The time for making bread from scratch is not something many "working" women have
- Promoted very heavily in tradwife cultures especially, buying processed and inorganic is being a "bad" woman
- Lobotomy core… [https://culted.com/wtf-is-lobotomy-core/](https://culted.com/wtf-is-lobotomy-core/)
- "prioritizing health over convenience" shames people with less time, people don't not want to feed their children well, but it's a privilege connected to higher economic standing and the time to make goldfish crackers from scratch

### Social Media and Discourse, how is Gender involved

Data Feminist Lenses with this in mind…

- These videos alone are not the full picture, they are connected to larger contexts of trad wife culture and alt-right pipelines
- Algorithmic and text examinations of these videos show their intersections with traditional culture and harm
- Women's spaces in digital culture should be community but they set representations of gender roles that can be nebulous and unclear
- Embracing the pluralism and messiness that comes with baking
- Compare and contrast church communities and baking, global VS specific analysis

#### Discussions

- Can this be seen in other communities?

## Data Feminism Scenarios

Where is power being reinforced? Whose emotions are being heard? What hierarchies are involved? Is there a pluralistic approach?

##### Scenario One:

- Anya is centring herself and needs in the research over vulnerable peoples
- It's hard to see this from her perspective as the researcher

##### Liam Scenario:

- Showing what in crime fiction, but there's no why… why are these trends emerging in his text analysis
- Issues with binary categories
- Which stories is he using? Who was writing them?

##### Maya Scenario:

- Defining what the scene is, who is part of the scene and who isn't… who counts
- What communities is she part of? How does this impact her decision to include

- This is especially relevant given the mortal quality of paper zines

- How could the involvement of the city challenge who is part of the community

#### Use the data feminism principles to shape the rest of your reading and research for the term

- Bring them into your discussions and research
- Drop them in at different points to bring up things that might be missing

#### Next time: public humanities

- Updates on studioDH and public facing work from Amanda
- These perspectives become even more important in DH with the community, as this research impacts people in the community and their learning
- These lenses make it clear how important data feminism is in regards to engage with "the public" and our knowledge
