# Scott Coleman
- PhD student working with Shawn, he works on a project and is concerned about the digital infrastructure that allows us to think about how we create and formulate metadata in our research
- Obsidian is how he does his research structuring
- Creativity as the process, not the final output

## Obsidian presentation, Obsidian as an archeological tool for the classroom
- obsidian is completely customizable, it can be as simple or easy as you want
- obsidian as a mode of experiential learning, **process** over **results**, disrupting linear thinking, generous thinking, failing gloriously, and knowledge creation
	- allowing more people as collaborators and stakeholders in your work
- **generous thinking-** a mode of engagement that emphasizes listening over responding
### Obsidian
- obsidian is a free local notetaking markdown software that makes it easier for you to takek notes
- the notes are plaintext and can be modified by plugins and shared in community
- the plain text files are safe and durable, they will be stored for future use regardless of software and OS
- the files are future proof for personal knowledge management (PKM), the layout is very simple and plaintext 
- thinking over app mentality
- obsidian becomes a form of digital archaeology, 
	- the archaeology site is the parent obsidian folder
	- the trenches are the child folders
	- the material culture are the files
	- the descriptions by excavators are metadata

- seeing your notes and research as a form of storytelling and development
### Classroom Application, Playing with Obsidian
- [ Scott's website](https://www.roguehistory.ca/), with resources for Obsidian
- obsidian uses wikis and tags to develop your project management they are double brackets in obsidian `[[notename]]`
- for example, this links to last class' note [[feb-25]]
- you can do CMD + E to get out of edit mode
- "Interlinked notes reflect oneâ€™s thinking about how concepts might relate, thus visualizing the structure of your understanding" - Shawn
- on the right side bar, you can see all the links in a page
- you can also use #'s to find tags that connect your notes with themes, you can search by themes
- the only tough thing about obsidian is its software is slightly limited due to its local capabilities
- graph view helps to find interconnecting notes and ideas
	- this system inherently encourages you to think critically about how you link your notes, fostering interlinking and intention in your organization
- explore plugins alone, its easy to get stuck in the weeds of them
### Obsidian in Practice
- how to use obsidian to create a cohesive narrative
- it allows people to see your thinking in process as an open thinking front facing notebook\
- allows for your thinking to be evolutionary and process focused
- publish is done with an obsidian subscription, but there are free alternatives
- you can go through the pages with specific notes
- how to collaborate: readers can see your process and you can loop in researchers
	- the public can engage
	- hypothesis annotation, tagging, and private and public spaces'
	- history as a process of engagement
### General Discussion
- using computational creativity to apply to our research process
- it requires structure and habit, but has fruitful potential
- it helps make your research novel if you can put effort into producing it
- recognize that there will be trial and error, failure, but embrace that
- it doesn't need to be online, but it's a good hub for supervising and research
- there are pdf plugins (PDF++)
- [bridging Zotero to obsidian ](https://medium.com/@alexandraphelan/an-updated-academic-workflow-zotero-obsidian-cffef080addd)
- ensure plugins are consistently updated to avoid issues
- next week coffee hour, email Shawn to keep me in mind even though I can't come
