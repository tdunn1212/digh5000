# Kegan Presentation

***Text analysis: using tools to analyze larger pieces of text***
- Kegan's work focuses on text analysis as a tool to avoiding bias and a powerful tool for working with a lot of data
- Text analysis is pre-digital, a German clergyman attempted to analyze the songs of Zion, finding how many times each member of the Holy Trinity appeared

***Text analysis falls under broader approaches of image analysis, network analysis, text mining, and topic modelling, sentiment analysis***
- One mode of data analysis is narrow, it can't analyze multiple mediums of data

Text analysis is a series of tools that identify themes, characteristics, and patterns across large bodies of text
- You can do quantitative and qualitative text analysis
- Analyzes structured/semi-structured text data
- Needs a corpus to analyze the text
	- Allows the computers to understand the text and punctuation, differentiating between the two
	- Also needs to change the words to their root form to avoid "look" and "looks" from being separately categorized

###### Main Approaches
- Conversation analysis
- Analysis of discourse positions
- Critical discourse analysis
- Content analysis
- Foucauldian analysis
- Analysis of text as social information
- Word counting (most simple)
- Narrative analysis (structural, functional, sociological)

***Sample of Tools: Concordancer, Voyant, WordSeer (uses metadata), TAPor, WordSmith***

Text analysis tools save time, allow for consistency, deeper aggregation and analysis of text

**Sentiment Analysis: the process of analyzing text to gather sentiment and emotional tone based on a body of text**

###### Shortcomings
- Text analysis has language problems that might overlook other languages and the structural power they enable
- Text analysis might overlook semantic quality
- The text analysis tools available either oversimplify or present a skill barrier for users
- English should not be a "default language" for text analysis
- Models might not be suited to the kinds of text you are analyzing
- Imperfect data (incomplete, dirty, fantasy) might distort your findings

##### Discussion Qs
- In your research, how might you use text analysis?
- What interests you about this approach?
- What are other shortcomings that you can imagine for these approaches?
	- Who is training the data and what findings do they want
	- Lack of transparency in this, especially as we depend on generative AI tools
- ***AI is models of culture, not models of intelligence - Shawn Graham***
- Topic analysis/text analysis of your own work/writingâ€¦ what kinds of things do you turn to, what do you say?

# Housekeeping

- Register for DHSI
- Presentations, just give stuff to think about and an exploration

##### DH experiment

- Documenting your thinking into a DH experiment and how it changes your thinking and approach to a DH project
- Hosted on GitHub, which makes it open and allows for easy data sharing
- Can this be AI girlfriends?
- 10 github diary entries on your progress
	- For your future help
	- Un-essay at the end, it can be any format that feels appropriate for your stuff
	- Argue why this format is best for your work
##### General Thoughts
- Re: DH and the importance of open data, we can see the consequences of this with the rollout of project 2025 and DEI initiatives being stripped in the federal government
